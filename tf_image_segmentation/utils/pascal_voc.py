    Consider running convert_pascal_berkeley_augmented_mat_annotations_to_png() after extraction.
    
    The PASCAL VOC dataset can be downloaded from here:
    http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/voc2012/VOCtrainval_11-May-2012.tar
    Consider specifying root full names for both of them as arguments for this function
    after extracting them.
    The function has three type of train/val splits(credit matconvnet-fcn):
    
        Let BT, BV, PT, PV, and PX be the Berkeley training and validation
        sets and PASCAL segmentation challenge training, validation, and
        test sets. Let T, V, X the final trainig, validation, and test
        sets.

        Mode 1::
              V = PV (same validation set as PASCAL)

        Mode 2:: (default))
              V = PV \ BT (PASCAL val set that is not a Berkeley training
              image)

        Mode 3::
              V = PV \ (BV + BT)

        In all cases:

              S = PT + PV + BT + BV
              X = PX  (the test set is uncahgend)
              T = (S \ V) \ X (the rest is training material)
    Parameters
    ----------
    pascal_root : string
        Path to the PASCAL VOC dataset root that is usually named 'VOC2012'
        after being extracted from tar file.
    pascal_berkeley_root : string
        Path to the PASCAL Berkeley VOC dataset root that is usually named 'benchmark_RELEASE'
        after being extracted from tar file.
    mode: int
        The type of train/val data split. Read the function main description for more info.
    Returns
    -------
    image_annotation_pairs : [[(string, string), .. , (string, string)][(string, string), .., (string, string)]]
        Array with filename pairs with fullnames.
