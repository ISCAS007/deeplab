    Given the resnet_v1_101_8s to resnet_v1_101 model mapping dict which is returned by
    resnet_v1_101_8s() function, remove the mapping for the fc8 variable. This is done because this
    variable is responsible for final class prediction and is different for different
    tasks. Last layer usually has different size, depending on the number of classes
    to be predicted. This is why we omit it from the dict and those variables will
    be randomly initialized later.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    resnet_v1_101_variables_mapping : dict {string: variable}
        Dict which maps the resnet_v1_101_8s model's variables to resnet_v1_101 checkpoint variables
        names. Look at resnet_v1_101_8s() function for more details.

    updated_mapping : dict {string: variable}
        Dict which maps the resnet_v1_101_8s model's variables to resnet_v1_101 checkpoint variables
        names without logits layer mapping.

    """Returns the resnet_v1_101_8s model definition.
    The function returns the model definition of a network that was described
    in 'DeepLab: Semantic Image Segmentation with Deep Convolutional Nets,
    Atrous Convolution, and Fully Connected CRFs' by Chen et al.
    The network subsamples the input by a factor of 8 and uses the bilinear
    upsampling kernel to upsample prediction by a factor of 8. This means that
    if the image size is not of the factor 8, the prediction of different size
    will be delivered. To adapt the network for an any size input use 
    adapt_network_for_any_size_input(resnet_v1_101_8s, 8). Note: the upsampling kernel
    is fixed in this model definition, because it didn't give significant
    improvements according to aforementioned paper.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    image_batch_tensor : [batch_size, height, width, depth] Tensor
        Tensor specifying input image batch
    number_of_classes : int
        An argument specifying the number of classes to be predicted.
        For example, for PASCAL VOC it is 21.
    is_training : boolean
        An argument specifying if the network is being evaluated or trained.
    
    Returns
    -------
    upsampled_logits : [batch_size, height, width, number_of_classes] Tensor
        Tensor with logits representing predictions for each class.
        Be careful, the output can be of different size compared to input,
        use adapt_network_for_any_size_input to adapt network for any input size.
        Otherwise, the input images sizes should be of multiple 8.
    resnet_v1_101_8s_variables_mapping : dict {string: variable}

        names. We need this to initilize the weights of resnet_v1_101_8s model with resnet_v1_101 from
